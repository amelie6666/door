## Smart Device Theme

>im going to be making a smart door that closes it self if someone walks out of the room. basically if you walk into the room and then walk out the door will automatactilly close, my idea is when your parents walk in your room and they don't close the door when they leave the bedroom,what will happen is when they leave the room the door will automactically close by it self.
