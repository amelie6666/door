## Smart Device Theme

>im going to be making a smart door that closes it self if someone walks out of the room. basically if you walk into the room and then walk out the door will automatactilly close, my diea is when your parents walk in your room and they dont close the door, what will happen is when they leave the room the door will close by it self.
